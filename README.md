# Roadmap and Notes
- [] I should encrypt the config file in the mongodb database
- [] Encrypt Database Scan Result
- [] Proper Auth for Agents on All Endpoints
- [] Security Check for each endpoint
- [X] I should add a reference to the organization from the agent model, like that i can know to which organization the agent belong directly if i have the agent data. It will be useful for the integrator account.
